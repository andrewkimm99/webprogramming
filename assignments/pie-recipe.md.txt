# Pie recipe

You will create several files related to a recipe web site for a fictional pie company named Granny's Pies.

## Pie Recipe Page

The second part is to recreate a specific web page of a recipe for lemon meringue pie, stored in a file named pie.html. Unlike index.html, this page must exactly match the appearance specified in this document. 

You can use [skeleton](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/16au/homework/1/output/skeleton.txt).

### Heading

The pie web page's title text should be Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie . 
All headings on the page should use a foreground color of #A4A400 (red=164, green=164, blue=0) and a background color of #F0F0F0 (red=240, green=240, blue=240). The font families for headings are: Lucida Sans Unicode, Helvetica, Arial, or any sans-serif font available on the system (in that order). The page's main heading is aligned to the center of the page body, and uses a 22pt bold font. Other headings on the page are left aligned and appear in an 18pt normal font. All headings should be underlined. 

### Content

The overall page's body should have a white background. Text in the body should have a foreground color of #404040 (red=64, green=64, blue=64) and use an 11pt font. The font families for page text are Georgia, Garamond, or any serif font available on the system. Any links on the page should use the color #A4A400 (red=164, green=164, blue=0), matching the color of the page headings.

In the Ingredients list, the underlined words "tbsp" and "tsp" are abbreviations for "tablespoons" and "teaspoon" respectively. When the user hovers the mouse over these abbreviations, the full word should appear as a tooltip. At the end of the Directions, the deleted word "cake" with a strike-out line through it is replaced by the word "pie". After the Links section there is a short copyright notice that appears as a section of pre-formatted text in a monospace font. The text is spaced such that the second line is indented by 2 spaces and the third line by 4 spaces.

Names of the four major steps of the recipe directions (such as "Preheat Oven") are strongly emphasized. The quotations from the users appear in an italic font as indented blocks with background color #FFFFA8 (red=255, green=255, blue=168). Some words in the last quote are bolded for emphasis.

Choose the picture of the pie using Google and insert it.


###Extra features (Try these if you have more time)

- The "Home" link should go to your index.html page. Use a relative URL and assume it is located on the same site and directory as pie.html.

- Favicon: Set the page to have a "favorites icon" ("favicon"). Use absolute URLs to link to all images. Use: https://webster.cs.washington.edu/images/pie-icon.gif

- Pie bullet: Set all bulleted lists of items on the page to use an image for their bullet icon rather than the normal black circle. Use the following image (use absolute URLs to link to all images): https://webster.cs.washington.edu/images/pie-icon.gif 

- Wide headings: Place 0.25em horizontal spacing between neighboring letters in all headings on the page.
